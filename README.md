# Inverse Reinforcement Learning in Contextual MDPs

This repository contains the code files that we used in our work to construct two environments and test three learning methods.
The environments in this repository:
1. Driving simulator
2. Dynamic treatment regime

To run the simulations clone the repository and run each file under:
<Simulator environment>/<Linear \ non_linear>/<learning method>/<run file>.py

the jupyter notebooks are used to plot the performance results on each environment.

 

in this work we use the processed data from point85AI git repository that can be found at:
https://github.com/point85AI/Policy-Iteration-AI-Clinician
the data set we use to construct the dynamic treatment regime can be found at: 
/data/normalized_data.mat
is should be placed at:
Dynamic treatment regime/data/normalized_data.mat
